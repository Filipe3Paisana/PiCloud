### Summary of Architecture for Private Cloud with Fragmentation and File Recovery


#### **Key Components of the Architecture**

1. **Two Datacenters (Active-Passive) with Kubernetes**:
   - Each **datacenter** will be a Kubernetes cluster located in different places (one at your house and the other at your colleague's house), with one being **active** and the other **passive**, configured as **Active-Passive** for high availability.
   - **Cloudflare** manages load balancing and failover between the two datacenters. While the active datacenter handles all requests, the passive datacenter is activated only in the event of a failure of the active one.
   - Within each datacenter, there will be **two pods** in an **Active-Active** scheme, where each pod will contain a **WEB service**, an **API**, and a local **database**.
   - **Kubernetes** manages internal communication between the pods within each datacenter, utilizing the internal network for load balancing and service discovery.

2. **File Fragmentation (APIs)**:
   - The APIs in each datacenter are responsible for **fragmenting large files** into smaller parts. These parts (fragments) are identified with **metadata**, which includes information about location, order, and replicas.
   - The **fragmentation** process uses techniques such as **Erasure Coding** or **Sharding**, ensuring that even with the loss of some fragments, the file can be reconstructed.

3. **Distribution of Fragments in Nodes**:
   - The fragments are distributed to **storage nodes** that may be **inside or outside the datacenters**.
   - The API selects nodes based on availability and geographic proximity, ensuring efficient and balanced distribution.
   - Each fragment may have **multiple replicas** distributed across different nodes to ensure resilience. This means that if a node fails, the fragments will still be accessible from other nodes.

4. **Replication and Monitoring of Fragments**:
   - **Replication**: The API implements the replication of fragments across multiple nodes to ensure that even in the event of a failure of one or more nodes, the fragments can be retrieved from their replicas.
   - **Monitoring**: The API monitors the health of the nodes and the availability of the fragments. If a node fails, new replicas can be automatically generated and redistributed to other available nodes.
   - The replication of fragments does not require continuous communication between the datacenters, making synchronization efficient and asynchronous.

5. **File Reconstruction**:
   - When requested, the API queries the **metadata** database to obtain the location of the fragments and then retrieves the necessary fragments from the nodes.
   - The retrieval of fragments is done in a **parallel** manner to optimize the speed of reconstruction.
   - The API checks the **integrity** of the fragments using **checksums** or other techniques, and once retrieved, reconstructs the original file.
   - If any fragment is inaccessible, the API attempts to access a replica or issues an error if too many fragments are missing.

6. **Distributed Nodes (Inside and Outside the Datacenter Network)**:
   - The nodes storing the fragments may be located both **inside** and **outside** the datacenters. Each node is identified by a **unique ID** and provides an interface for the API to request fragments.
   - These nodes may be in different **networks** or geographical locations, allowing greater flexibility in the distribution of fragments.
   - Communication between the nodes and the datacenter APIs will be done securely (via HTTPS or other encryption protocols) to protect data in transit.

7. **Security and Communication**:
   - **Data Encryption**: The fragments should be stored encrypted on the nodes, ensuring that even if a node is compromised, the data remains protected.
   - **Node Authentication**: Only authenticated and trusted nodes can participate in the storage and retrieval system.
   - **Secure Communication**: All traffic between the datacenters, nodes, and APIs will be protected by SSL/TLS, and the API can use **Cloudflare Tunnel** or another secure means to ensure that communication between distributed parts is safe and efficient.

8. **Failover and Redundancy**:
   - In the event of a failure of the **active** datacenter, Cloudflare automatically redirects traffic to the **passive** datacenter, which takes on the active role, maintaining service continuity.
   - As the metadata database is replicated across the datacenters, the system can quickly access the necessary information to reconstruct files and manage fragments.

### **Flow of Operation**

1. **Fragmentation**: The file is uploaded to the API, which fragments the file into multiple parts and generates metadata for each fragment.
2. **Distribution**: The fragments are distributed to available nodes, and replicas are created to ensure redundancy.
3. **Storage**: The fragments are stored encrypted and distributed efficiently across the nodes.
4. **Monitoring and Replication**: The API monitors the health of the nodes and the integrity of the fragments, generating new replicas when necessary.
5. **Reconstruction**: When a file is requested, the API retrieves the necessary fragments from the nodes, checks their integrity, and reconstructs the original file.

### **Final Summary**
- **Two datacenters**, managed via **Cloudflare** in an **Active-Passive** scheme, ensure high availability and failover.
- Within each datacenter, the system is **Active-Active**, with two pods running the **WEB**, **API**, and **DB** services, and utilizing **Kubernetes** for internal management.
- The files are fragmented by the API, and the fragments are distributed and replicated in **distributed nodes**, both inside and outside the datacenters, ensuring **resilience** and **security**.
- Communication between nodes and APIs is done securely, with the possibility of using **Cloudflare Tunnel** to create a reliable network.
- The system is capable of **reconstructing files** by requesting fragments from different nodes, ensuring efficient recovery and data protection.

This architecture distributes the load and increases the **resilience** of the system, with the ability to handle node or datacenter failures, while always maintaining the capability to recover fragmented files.
