## üöÄ Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are fragmented and stored across multiple geographically distributed nodes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface for file uploads, downloads, and management.
- **Advanced Security**: TLS for data in transit, AES for storage, and robust authentication mechanisms.
- **AI Integration**: Predicts node performance and redistributes file fragments for optimal resource usage.
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling by adding more nodes to the network.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with Docker and Kubernetes for efficient deployment and maintenance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: [Go](https://golang.org/) for API and node services.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive web experience.
- **Containerization**: Docker for isolating components and Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Security**: Cloudflare for enhanced protection and secure exposure of APIs.
- **AI Models**: HistGradientBoostingRegressor for predicting node performance.
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi for local node hosting.

## üìö How It Works

1. **File Upload**: Files are fragmented and metadata is stored in a central database.
2. **File Distribution**: Fragments are distributed across nodes, ensuring redundancy and availability.
3. **File Retrieval**: Fragments are reassembled and delivered securely to the user.
4. **Node Monitoring**: AI models monitor node health and redistribute fragments as needed.
